Viber Bot starter kit build as .NET 5 API


Kick Starter for building Viber Bot in .NET 5.
I needed this for company project, couldn't find any fresh examples so i decided to build this as starting point for buiding Viber Bot with c# and .NET 5.
It's just initial setup , class library and starting chat example.

If you will want to use this Starter Kit, You will need Viber Developers Account:

You will need token and your published application (https only works!) URL.
