Kick Starter for building Viber Bot in .NET 5.
I needed this for company project, couldn't find any fresh examples so i decided to build this as starting point for buiding Viber Bot with c# and .NET 5.
It's just initial setup , class library and starting chat example.

If you will want to use this Starter Kit, You will need Viber Developers Account:
https://partners.viber.com/

Then Setup Your BOT

You will need token and your published application (https only works!) URL.
Add it into appsettings.json

deploy api to your public server and Defined URL and execute over swagger set-web-hook method
Your BOT should be ok and running after that. And you will be able to use bot in Viber.

Happy Coding!
